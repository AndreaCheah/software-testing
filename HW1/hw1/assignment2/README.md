### Part b 

Error: "memory error: out of bound pointer".  The code casts `(char*)p + sizeof(long)` to a new `cell*` called `cur`. However, `p` was allocated using `malloc(sizeof(cell))`, which provides only 24 bytes, since `long v`, `struct cell* next`, and `struct cell* prev` has 8 bytes each. 

KLEE performs memory bounds checking. It detects that casting to `(char*)p + sizeof(long)` moves the pointer 8 bytes forward into the middle of the allocated object.  

### Part c

When I run the program without klee related calls in my host, there was a crash with the error `malloc(): corrupted top size` `Aborted`. This shows that the host system did detect the error, but only after memory was corrupted due to out-of-bounds access.  
In contrast, KLEE caught the issue immediately when the invalid pointer was used: `KLEE: ERROR: test_unit.c:20: memory error: out of bound pointer`.  
Therefore, while both detected the error, KLEE detected it earlier.
